Browser Reviewer will scan the selected path for supported browser artifacts from **Firefox** and **Chrome/Chromium-based browsers**, including:

- üïì Browsing history  
- ‚¨áÔ∏è Download history  
- üîñ Bookmarks  
- üß† Autofill form data  

Once processed, the data will appear in the main table, where you can filter, search, tag, and comment on individual entries.
